====================

Project 4 of CSCI E-15

The project is a continuation of the Microblog project that was started in p2.  A new project and database were
created utilizing the framework and mySQL.

Additions to p2 include the following:

	- Validation during signup to ensure no duplicate emails are used;
	- Validate on the signup, login, and profile pages using jquery validation plugin;
	- Feature to allow editting a previous post;
	- Feature to upload picture to user profile;
	- Feature to add web site to user profile.

The SQL database is the same structure that was used in p2 with the addition the following fields in the user table:

	- profile_pic;
	- site.

Notes:

(1) My git database is <p4a.peterswebpage.biz.git> not <p4.peterswebpage.biz.git> due to errors in the original 
repository that could not be resolved - had to recreate repository toward end of project.  Both of the repositories 
are still located in my account on git;

(2) Submitted project on December 25, 2014 and updated git repository and server on December 26th.  Please consider 
either project depending on value - thanks.
